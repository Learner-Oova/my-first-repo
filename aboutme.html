        I'm a Microbiology student of the <b> Great Obafemi Awolowo University </b>, currently an incoming final year student.

        Technology is a thing of science, so we can basically say I'm currently doing my hobby i.e learning website design.

        I don't usually like to talk about myself but I had to because I was given an assignment. I hope you enjoyed this little

        teaching you a lot about myself. Thanks for reading. <img src="C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Pictures\backiee-98927.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
